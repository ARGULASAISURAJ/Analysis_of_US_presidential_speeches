From the above Bar_plots we can see that all presedential speeches of Republican and democratic presedents are compounded to aproximately 1. This might be due to the high positive words used after winning elections.
One intresting thing to observe from the graph is the speech of Andrew Johnson in 1865. The polarity of the speech is negative. Also, George washington speech of 1793 which is at approx~ 075 when compared to all other speeches at ~1.

*By Party*
Democratic    0.999627
Others        0.852627
Republican    0.999886

Above are the top 3 presidents by positive sentiment score in each group of parties
